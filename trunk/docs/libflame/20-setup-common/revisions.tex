Each copy of \libflame is named according to its subversion\footnote{We use
the subversion version control system to manage changes and synchronize
updates among developers.
}
%For more information about subversion and other topics of interest to
%developers, please see Chapter \ref{chapter:maint}.}
{\em revision} number.
These revision numbers are positive integers which uniquely identify various
states of the \libflame source tree and are usually preceded by a lowercase
``r''.
By contrast, milestone {\em version} numbers, such as ``2.0'', are somewhat
arbitrary labels that refer to long contiguous revision intervals.
As an example, version 1.0 was associated with revisions r1307 through r1753.
Revision numbers are incremented automatically every time a developer commits
a change or set of changes to the \libflame source tree.
Version numbers, however, identify milestone releases and increase rather
infrequently.
%Usually, the version number is increased only when \libflame developers decide
%that enough features and bug fixes have been added to be considered newsworthy
%to its target audience.
Usually, milestones are released (and the version number bumped) only
when \libflame developers decide that enough features and bug fixes have been
added to be considered newsworthy to its target audience.
