Known Issues

---

The following is a list of known issues with libflame.

 o It is not yet possible to create a matrix with arbitrary row and column
   (ie: where both strides are non-unit). But we plan to add this functionality
   soon.

 o Due to limitations in the current level-3 interfaces, all blocked variants
   implementing Hermitian rank-2k update (her2k) suffer from the inability to
   compute the correct result when the alpha scalar parameter is complex and
   has a non-zero imaginary component. (Note: this is difficult to fix.)

 o The algorithm-by-blocks for incremental up-and-downdating via the UT
   transform requires that the number of rows in C and D be equal. We will most
   likely fix this as soon as someone complains.

 o A parallel region cannot be used around the _solve() routine for either
   FLASH_QR_UT_inc() or FLASH_CAQR_UT_inc(). This is due to the fact that
   these routines use FLASH repartitioning. Enclosing this functionality
   in a parallel region means that FLASH views are allocated and then freed
   before threads are dispatched.
