libflame is a set of free libraries providing:

- A modern object-based framework with which to build linear algebra
  applications.
- User-friendly interfaces to most routines found in the Basic Linear
  Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) and many commonly used operations found in
  the Linear Algebra Package (LAPACK).
- Support for all four standard numerical datatypes: single precision real,
  double precision real, single precision complex, and double precision
  complex.
- Competitive sequential (single threaded) and parallel (multithreaded)
  performance on commodity architectures.
- Support for easy GNU-like configuration, building, and installation.
- A reference for students, educators, and other academics interested in
  studying all known algorithmic variants of commonly used linear algebra
  operations.

libflame is maintained by the FLAME research group in the Department of
Computer Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin, and released as
free software under the Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
