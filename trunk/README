Release Notes

---

Thank you for deciding to try out the libflame linear algebra library.
Please let us know what you think of our methodology and implementations
by sending us an email at flame@cs.utexas.edu!

Please read the LICENSE file for information on copying and distributing
this software.

For detailed instructions on how to configure, build, install, and link
against libflame, please visit the official libflame webpage:

  http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/libflame/

We also encourage you to refer to the libflame reference manual. This
manual contains all the information you need to get started with
libflame, including installation directions, usage examples, and a
complete API reference. If you have LaTeX installed on your system, you
may simply change into the 'docs/libflame' subdirectory of the top-level
directory of the libflame source tree and build the document from its
source. If you do not have LaTeX installed, then you may find the
document through the libflame web page at the URL listed above.

The Elemental software package is also included in this distribution of
libflame. Elemental is a C++ framework for distributed-memory dense linear
algebra that strives to be fast, portable, and programmable. It can be
thought of as a generalization of PLAPACK to element-by-element
distributions that also makes use of recent algorithmic advances from the
FLAME project. Elemental usually outperforms both PLAPACK and ScaLAPACK,
however, it heavily relies on MPI collectives so a good MPI implementation
is crucial. For further information, please visit the project homepage at:
