\begin{tabular}{lp{4.2in}}
{\bf Target} & {\bf Function} \\
% --------------------------------------
{\tt all}
&
Invoke the \libs target. \\
% --------------------------------------
{\tt check}
&
Verify that \configure has been run. \\
% --------------------------------------
{\tt libs}
&
Invoke the {\tt check} target and then build the libflame and
liblapack2flame library archives. \\
% --------------------------------------
{\tt install}
&
Invoke the \libs target and then copy the library archives and header
files to their respective {\tt lib} and {\tt include} subdirectories
of the install prefix directory, which is {\tt \$HOME/flame} by
default.
Also create symbolic links (with {\tt ln -s}) to the library files
and {\tt include} subdirectory so that the symbolic links do not
contain the architecture or version strings. \\
% --------------------------------------
{\tt install-without-symlinks}
&
Similar to \install except that no symbolic links are installed. \\
% --------------------------------------
{\tt clean}
&
Remove all object files and previously-built library archives from the
{\tt obj} and {\tt lib} directories for the current build system only.
(Recall that the curerent build system is written to
{\tt config.sys\_type}.)
Build products built for other systems will not be touched. \\
% --------------------------------------
{\tt cleanmk}
&
Remove all makefile fragments from the source tree. \\
% --------------------------------------
{\tt distclean}
&
Invoke \cleanns, \cleanmk, and then remove all other intermediate build files
and directories that are created either by \configure or one of the autotools
such as \autoconfns. \\
% --------------------------------------
{\tt send-thanks}
&
Use {\tt mail} to send the libflame developers a short thank-you message. \\
% --------------------------------------

\caption{A list of ``phony'' \make targets defined in the libflame
\makefilens.
%Note that this list is not exhaustive.
%The libflame \makefile defines other phony \make targets that are used
%internally to aid in the execution of those in this list, and still others
%that perform functions that are primarily only of interest to libflame
%developers.
Note that not all targets guarantee that action will take place.
Most targets will not fire if \make determines that the target is already
up-to-date.
For example, invoking the \clean target will not remove any object files if
they do not exist.
