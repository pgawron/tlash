libflame Contributors
---------------------

The ongoing Formal Linear Algebra Methods Environment project is a
collaboration by a large number of people. libflame is the most visible
product of this group, and while not everyone has contributed code
directly, many people's ideas have gone into improving libflame,
especially those which have been published in the FLAME project's
library of working notes, conference papers, and journal articles:

A few organizations also deserve thanks for their technical assistance:

  The staff at the Texas Advanced Computing Center for granting access to their
  compute resources and technical support.

  Universidad Jaume I, for granting access to a 16 CPU Itanium2 SMP system used
  at various stages in our research. 

  National Instruments, for their interest and support of our research goals,
  including their generous financial support. 

  NEC Systems of America, for granting access to two 16 CPU Itanium2 SMP systems
  used extensively in testing and benchmarking.


And finally, we acknowledge these individuals for inspiring various aspects of
the libflame build system:

 Emile van Bergen, whose stack-implementing makefile snippets formed the basis 
 for the include mechanism of the repository's makefile infrastructure.

 Greg Thomsen of ARL:UT, for demonstrating by example some nifty features of 
 GNU make.
