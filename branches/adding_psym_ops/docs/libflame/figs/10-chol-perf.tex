\caption{
Performance of Cholesky factorization implementations measured on a
24 core Intel ``Dunnington'' system.
Theoretical peak system performance is 255 GFLOPS.
libflame uses variant 3 while LAPACK uses variant 2.
For non-SuperMatrix experiments, MKL was invoked in multithreaded
mode.
For SuperMatrix experiments, MKL parallelism was disabled.
Blocksizes were tuned individually for each problem size tested.
