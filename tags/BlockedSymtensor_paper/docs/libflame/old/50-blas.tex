\chapter{Linear Algebra Operations}
\label{chapter:blas}


We provide the parallel implementations of the BLAS
(Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms).  The BLAS routines
are categorized into vector-vector, matrix-vector, and
matrix-matrix operations called 
level-1, level-2, and level-3 BLAS.

\section{Local BLAS Routines}

We provide localized implementations of the BLAS routines.
These routines can only be called if the data for each object 
all reside within one processor (or duplicated).  
Their interfaces are the same as the general BLAS routines, 
except that the invocation has the form {\tt PLA\_Local\_} 
followed by the name of the BLAS routine in lowercase
(i.e., {\tt PLA\_Local\_gemm}).
